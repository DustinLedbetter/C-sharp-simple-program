# C-simple-program
A simple program to begin my C# refreshment

The program just has two radio buttons and a submit button. The user selects a radio button and hits submit. Each one has a message box pop up saying something different. The purpose was simply to get use to the syntax and style of C# again before coding a bigger program.
